//Write the unit tests. Each unit test should have four parts : Setup, Exercise, Verify, and Teardown.

//Make every unit test fulfill the requirements in Chapter 25 of the textbook, and all the test cases meet the requirements of Chapter 14 of the textbook.
//Look at TestMove and TestPosition as inspiration as to how these unit tests should look.

//Run the tests. We expect the tests to fail. Write stub code for the classes under tests so they do compile but fail the test.




// Include testMove, testPosition, testPiece, testPawn in this test runner
